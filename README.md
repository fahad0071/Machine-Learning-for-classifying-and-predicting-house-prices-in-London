# Machine-Learning-for-classifying-and-predicting-house-prices-in-London

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for implementing a machine learning project focused on classifying and predicting house prices in London. The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas, data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, k-means, k-nearest neighbor, and more.


### Introduction

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning system that can classify and predict house prices in London based on a given set of features. By applying various machine learning algorithms to a cleaned and preprocessed dataset, we aim to analyze the relationship between different features and house prices, identify important predictors, and create accurate prediction models.
